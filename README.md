This is my android application for the students database to take attendances using qr scan, login signup, admin access to add/delete teacher and student, an access to all sem books under seperate dept sections.
This has not been placed at google play store due to some errors.
But if you want to take a look at this then download it from this repository and install. Don't send it for review, if playstore askes, otherwise it might create issues.
